1. In all branches A, B, and C, customers prefer to use payment modes other than credit cards. Notably, despite the prevalence of digital payments, customers at Branch C are more likely to use cash. It is advisable for shopkeepers to promote the digitalization of basic activities.

2. Food and beverages, as well as fashion accessories, have lower average quantities than other products, which may be due to the store offering wholesale discounts on these items.

3. As there is already high demand for products in these categories, especially among men, the store manager should consider giving discounts on retail purchases.

4. Yagon is unique in that the peak shopping hour occurs in the evening, indicating that customers there prefer to shop later in the day due to potential daytime commitments. It is essential for shopkeepers to ensure sufficient night staff to prevent understaffing and maintain sales.

5. The gross income of the store is increasing at a decreasing rate, indicating a potential issue that needs addressing.

6. Women tend to shop more in the morning and afternoon, while men prefer to shop in the evening.

While we might have obtained certain understandings from the visual representations, it should be acknowledged that customers can be highly unpredictable and even these insights may not necessarily produce the desired outcomes. As this is beyond our control, our optimal course of action is to examine customer behavior and adjust our decisions accordingly.
